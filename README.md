# PlantMinder
    Project done by Kevin Bang, and I (Joon Gyu Choi)
    for GaTech CS3651 Prototyping Class at 2017 Spring semester.
    
    This project is for demonstrating how much we can do 
    with tools to make something new/special.
    
    We used bunch of mechanical tools like woodcutters,
    Solidworks for 3D printing and 3D printers.
    
    Class basically for Device Thread CS students,
    so all works are under control with arduino to move servos and sensors.
    
    Full descriptions are inside pdf final report,
    and basic solidwork design had been downloaded from https://grabcad.com/library/software/solidworks
    and modified by ourselves.
